DielectricSlab
  01: spectrum of Fabry-PÃ©rot resonances
  02: modes of 1-D PhC (PB, PBG, PB, PBG ...)
	(?? show also NZEpsMu?)
EWires [metallic wires oriented along electric field]
  01: spectrum	------------------------
  02: modes [eps<0, eps>0]
  03: dependence of plasma frequency on radius	------------------------
  04: dependence of plasma frequency on spacing ------------------------
HBars
  01: spectrum
  02: modes [1st mode, 2nd mode, 3rd mode]
EBars [high-permittivity, eps=600, cylindrical dielectric bars, oriented along the electric field]
  01: thickness scans for different epsilon (12, 20, 30, 70, 100, 600)
	as contour plots of k'/2pi/a, k"/2pi/a
  02: thin, spectrum and modes (PB, PBG, eps<0, PB)
  03: thick, spectrum and modes (PB, PBG, eps<0, PBG?, DNG, eps<0, PB)
  04: overthick, spectrum and modes (PB, PBG, PB, PBG, PB)
	 (analogy with diel slab?)
