__Slab__ made of dielectric
 * [ ] spectrum of Fabry-PÃ©rot resonances
 * [ ] modes of 1-D PhC (PB, PBG, PB, PBG ...), (?? show also NZEpsMu?)

__Wire array__ [metallic wires oriented along electric field]
 * [ ] spectrum	------------------------
 * [ ] modes [eps<0, eps>0]
 * [ ] dependence of plasma frequency on radius	------------------------
 * [ ] dependence of plasma frequency on spacing ------------------------

__Rod array__ parallel to H
 * [ ] spectrum
 * [ ] modes [1st mode, 2nd mode, 3rd mode]

__SRRs__ 
 * [ ] spectrum / cdh
 * [ ] with and without wires

__Dielectric spheres__ 
 * [ ] spectrum / cdh
 * [ ] 

__Wire pairs__ 
 * [ ] spectrum / cdh

__Rod array__ parallel to E 
 [high-permittivity, cylindrical dielectric rods, oriented along the electric field]
 * [ ] thickness scans for different epsilon (12, 20, 30, 70, 100, 600), as contour plots of k'/2pi/a, k"/2pi/a
 * [ ] thin, spectrum and modes from MPB (PB, PBG, eps<0, PB)
 * [ ] thick, spectrum and modes from MPB (PB, PBG, eps<0, PBG?, DNG, eps<0, PB)
 * [ ] overthick, spectrum and modes (PB, PBG, PB, PBG, PB)
	 (analogy with diel slab?)
