==Examples of metamaterial scattering parameters computation==
====Basic structures====
__Slab__ made of dielectric
 * [ ] spectrum of pure Bragg PBGs
 * [ ] modes of 1-D PhC (PB, PBG, PB, PBG ...), (?? show also NZEpsMu?)
 * [ ] fill-fraction scan (point out zero-width gaps = Fabry-PÃ©rot resonances)

__Wires__ [metallic wires oriented along electric field]
 * [ ] spectrum, analyze eps
 * [ ] modes [eps<0, eps>0 above omegap, PhC regime]
 * [ ] dependence of plasma frequency on wire radius
 * [ ] dependence of plasma frequency on spacing

__Cut wires__  parallel to __E__
 * [ ] spectrum
 * [ ] wire 

====Negative-permeability resonant structures====
__Rod array__ parallel to __H__
 * [ ] spectrum
 * [ ] modes [1st mode, 2nd mode, 3rd mode]
 * [ ] permittivity scan (refer to tunability)

__SRRs__ 
 * [ ] spectrum / cdh
 * [ ] with and without wires

__Wire pairs__ 
 * [ ] spectrum / cdh
 * [ ] 

__Dielectric spheres__ 
 * [ ] spacing-scan
 * [ ] ellipticity scan along __x__
 * [ ] ellipticity scan along __y__
 * [ ] ellipticity scan along __z__
 * [x] loss-scan
 * [ ] permittivity scan (refer to tunability)

====Negative-index structures====
__Dielectric spheres with wires__ 
 * [ ] principles (s, w, s+w)
 * [ ] wire radius scan

__Rod array__ parallel to E 
 [high-permittivity, cylindrical dielectric rods, oriented along the electric field]
 * [ ] thickness scans for different epsilon (12, 20, 30, 70, 100, 600), as contour plots of k'/2pi/a, k"/2pi/a
 * [ ] thin, spectrum and modes from MPB (PB, PBG, eps<0, PB)
 * [ ] thick, spectrum and modes from MPB (PB, PBG, eps<0, PBG?, DNG, eps<0, PB)
 * [ ] overthick, spectrum and modes (PB, PBG, PB, PBG, PB)
	 (analogy with diel slab?)

__Fishnet__
 * [ ] inter-layer z-distance scan
 * [ ] aperture size scan
 * [ ] aperture __x__-axis scan
 * [ ] aperture __y__-axis scan
 * [ ] 

====Studies of extraordinary transmission====
__Metallic slab__ parallel to the magnetic field
 * [ ] slab width (i.e. fill-fraction) scan
 * [ ] slab thickness scan
 * [ ] adding plastic layer - symmetric
 * [ ] adding plastic layer - single-sided
 * [ ]
